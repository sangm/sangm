This project relies entirely on conf.json file.
Entire website(mostly) is dynamically generated by the conf.json
file so that adding content to the website is not as tedious.

###Responsive
I have tried to implement the website with responsive design. I tackled
the problem by setting breakpoints whenever I felt that there was 
more screen estate instead of "hard setting" them by device specifications.
However, the mobile view was just for me to practice and understand more 
than anything. I have included some screenshots of what it looks like below.
